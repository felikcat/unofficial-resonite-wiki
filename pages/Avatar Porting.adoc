. Import your .fbx (Model) as a file instead of a 3D model.
. Save that file to your Inventory.
. In the top-right of the Main Menu, once "Synced" is displayed, then you can spawn that new model.

NOTE: Reason to do this is cause syncing to the Cloud is much faster than a Headless / Hosted server by a player.
