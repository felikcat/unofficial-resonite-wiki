== Desktop tips
. Tap kbd:[F6] to be able to select yourself with the Inspector.

== If you want someone to help you, do the following:
. Import your .fbx (Model) as a file instead of a 3D model.
. Save that file to your Inventory.
. In the top-right of the Main Menu, once "Synced" is displayed, then you can spawn that new model.

NOTE: Why: syncing to the Cloud is much faster than uploading to a Headless server, or a server hosted by a player.

== How to pin-point floating objects in your Avatar
. You can prod at bones to see what your floating objects are assigned to via BlendShapeWeights.
- Be sure to move around your limbs if in VR, as to pinpoint quicker what those floating objects are.

== PBS Metallic differences compared to ToonShader
. AlbedoTexture = MainTexture

== 1. Setting up the model
. To start with, you want to drag the .fbx of your model into Resonite. If this doesn't work, you have to go to Resonite's Main Menu -> Files, then find and double-click that model.
- You are importing a 3D Model -> Regular / Avatar -> Meters (m) if the model is measured like this -- if you do not know, use Auto Humanoid Height. Now, run the Import!

. Go to the Main Menu -> Home -> Avatar Creator. You will then select the Headset with the Dev Tool, and open an Inspector. Go up the Root until you see "Root: Avatar Creator". It should look like the following screenshot: +

- Keep the Headset's Position Z at 0, always.

. Avatar Creator -> Turn off "Use Symmetry", we're going to manually setup the hands.
- You want your hands to relatively look like this. Be sure to use the Gizmos (those red, green, and blue arrows) to line it up precisely:

. Now that your hands are finished, tap on Avatar Creator -> "Create" and now your model is setup! Now you should equip your avatar by deselecting/putting away your tool(s), then clicking on the model to "Equip Avatar". This will also show if there's any flaws, such as incorrect Headset positioning, which can be fixed later.
