== 1. Creating a custom nameplate
. Open an Inspector on yourself; in desktop mode, use kbd:[F6] to help with that. Note: In VR you should be able to select your nameplate directly by looking up and selecting it with the Dev Tool.

. Go up the Root until you get to your User: +

. Make a child inside your Model/Avatar using this button, then name it "ðŸ’³ Nameplate": +

. Drag *Name Badge*, *Icon Badges*, and *Live Indicator* into "ðŸ’³ Nameplate".

. Open "ðŸ’³ Nameplate", then click *Attach Component*. Add `Users -> Common Avatar System -> AvatarUserReferenceAssigner`

- Now we're going to drag out and click "ðŸ’³ Nameplate", so we see two Inspectors.

. For every *TargetUser* in *Name Badge*, *Icon Badges*, and *Live Indicator*, drag click *TargetUser* into AvatarUserReferenceAssigner's "References (List)". It should look as follows: +

. There are two things inside of your Name Badge to remove, there is "<noparse=", remove that: +

- Then remove what will override your custom Name Badge if left alone, which would be *LabelTargets*, *ColorTargets*, and *OutlineTargets*: +

. Feel free to do as you please with the nameplate, such as using custom materials, or simply changing the *TintColor* and *OutlineColor* as in this example: +

. Save your avatar after you're satifised. `Main Menu -> Inventory -> Save Avatar`. You can then `Set Avatar` and `Equip` it to not accidentally use your outdated avatar.

== 2. Tips
. You want to use as high of a font size as possible for better quality, it'll automatically be scaled down to `Name Badge -> TextRenderer` -> *Size*, and clamped to 32px Glyph Size by `Name Badge -> TextRenderer` -> *Font* -> *GlyphEmSize*. 

. `Name Badge -> TextUnlitMaterial` -> *ZTest* can be changed to "Always" to show the Name Badge no matter what, meaning people can see your Name Badge through walls.

. `Name Badge -> TextUnlitMaterial` -> *GlyphRenderMethod* "Raster" is preferrable if your custom font uses Raster graphics (commonly known as a Pixel or Bitmap font).
