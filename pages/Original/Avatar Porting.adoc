== Before proceeding
- Get familiar with xref:Desktop usage.adoc[Desktop usage] if you haven't thoroughly already.


== If you want someone to help you, do the following:
. Import your .fbx (Model) as a file instead of a 3D model.
. Save that file to your Inventory.
. In the top-right of the Main Menu, once "Synced" is displayed, then you can spawn that new model.

TIP: Why? Syncing to the Cloud is much faster than uploading to a Headless server, or a server hosted by a player.

== How to pin-point floating objects in your Avatar
. You can prod at bones to see what your floating objects are assigned to via BlendShapeWeights.
- Be sure to move around your limbs if in VR, as to pinpoint quicker what those floating objects are.

== PBS Metallic differences compared to ToonShader
. AlbedoTexture = MainTexture

== 1. Setting up the model
. To start with, you want to drag the .fbx of your model into Resonite. If this doesn't work, you have to go to Resonite's Main Menu -> Files, then find and double-click that model.
- You are importing a 3D Model -> Regular / Avatar -> Auto Humanoid Height. Now, run the Import!

. Go to the Main Menu -> Home -> Avatar Creator. You will then select the Headset with the Dev Tool, and open an Inspector. Go up the Root until you see "Root: Avatar Creator". It should look like the following screenshot: +

- Align the Headset as close to the center of the head as possible, then press 'Center Head Position'. Make sure the "VR" text sticks out in front of the head, you don't want to put the Headset too much into the head, otherwise you'll see your model's head in VR.

. Avatar Creator -> Turn off "Use Symmetry", we're going to manually setup the hands.
- You want your hands to relatively look like this. Be sure to use the Gizmos (those red, green, and blue arrows) to line it up precisely:

- If your hand grabber got screwed up, fix the Grabber and Shelf manually, such as this: +

. Now that your hands are finished, tap on Avatar Creator -> "Create" and now your model is setup!

WARNING: Do not equip the avatar yet, you will run into serious problems when we get to Head Proxies.

== 2. Setting up mouth movement and mouth textures
. Let's setup our mouths and mouth movement.
- First, we're going to set the main texture to the base state (neutral) image you've got. First, click the up arrow on the left of the Mouth material: +

- Drag the image to the AlbedoTexture slot (this is the main texture for PBS_Metallic):
image:Resonite_WafBDrXRHP.png[]

- In the Inspector: `CenteredRoot -> RootNode -> Face` (double-click it). Now scroll all the way down, then tap "Attach Component". The component we want is: `Assets -> Utility -> AssetMultiplexer<A> -> AssetMultiplexer<ITexture2D>`. Now, below "Assets (list):" you will see an Add button, tap it, then drag a picture of your mouth in its neutral/base state to slot 0: +

- Select the Proto Flux tool, and now drag the base state mouth texture to the Target: +

- Attach another Component, `Rendering -> DirectVisemeDriver`. 

- Now in the Inspector double-click to select the Head Proxy, scroll all the way down and attach the following components: `Media -> Utility -> VisemeAnalyzer`, `Users -> Common Avatar System -> Audio -> AvatarVoiceSourceAssigner`

- Drag the text *Source* under `VisemeAnalyzer` to *TargetReference* under `AvatarVoiceSourceAssigner`. It should look like this: +
image:Resonite_QzwpNNoP3r.png[]

. Now is a good time to deselect all your tools, then click on the avatar to Equip it, then to save it into your inventory: +
image:Resonite_9kD0jbaVUW.png[] +
Afterwards, equip a different avatar, then spawn in the avatar you just saved by double-clicking it.

. In the Inspector we are going back to `CenteredRoot -> RootNode -> Face`, scroll all the way down, and now you're going to line up every mouth texture with each slot of the DirectVisemeDriver. If done correctly, it'll look as follows (I excluded Laugh here; it technically goes up to 15): +

image:Resonite_eAguhtFZSU.jpg[]

. Add a slot underneath Face with the following button: 
image:Resonite_fmgMfqer1C.png[] +
Then name it VisemeFlux: +
image:Resonite_7ETqmVFhmV.png[] +

- Now equip the Proto Flux tool, we're going to drag out and Source (from the context menu) all of the vowels from VisemeAnalyzer, which should look like this when finished: +
image:Resonite_577JkwHn2b.jpg[]

. Context Menu -> Browse Nodes -> `Math -> ValueMaxMulti<T> -> ValueMaxMulti<long>`, then double-click where you want to place it.

- Now keep pressing the `+` sign until you have 15 operand slots, then link the sources to each operand slot: +
image:Resonite_bhMYG7z0Sz.png[]

. `Utility -> IndexOfFirstMatch -> IndexOfFirstValueMatch<T> -> IndexOfFirstValueMatch<float>`

- Move *Silence* to the second Match slot, then continue on moving the rest to the other 14 slots: +
image:Resonite_YEUjOtPOvd.jpg[]

. In the Inspector, go back to CenteredRoot -> RootNode -> Face, find `AssetMultiplexer<ITexture2D>`, then using the Proto Flux tool drag out "Index" and in the context menu tap "Drive": +
image:Resonite_W6QIesjcqi.png[]

. With the Proto Flux tool equipped, long select (desktop mode: holding kbd:[R]) until all of the ProtoFlux nodes are highlighted in a cyan color.

- In the Inspector go to `CenteredRoot -> RootNode -> Face -> Flux`, grab "Flux" and open its context menu, now you can pack our ProtoFlux into "Flux". It should look similar to this: +
image:Resonite_GmaUCg4nJn.png[]

- Now you have a moving mouth! Yay!
