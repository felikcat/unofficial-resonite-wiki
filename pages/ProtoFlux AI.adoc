== How-to
. Install https://www.cherry-ai.com/download[Cherry Studio].
. Run Cherry Studio, go to Settings, then set your Anthropic API Key and optionally disable SiliconFlow and/or other providers.
- Buy some API credits from Anthropic if you haven't done so already: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing
- OpenAI's thinking models such as o3-mini aren't suitable for MCP usage as of June 16 2025.

. Go to MCP Servers -> Add Server -> Quick Create, then replicate the following: +

- If this fails, ensure you already installed the required dependencies (should be a green check inside a circle on the top right) and tried changing the Package Registry away from Default.

. In the Assistants tab, ensure FluxMcp is selected, and also select the model on the top to "Claude 3.5 Haiku":

. Before asking anything, ensure that Resonite is left open so that the FluxMcp mod is working in the background.

. When asking, always ensure you put "ProtoFlux" somewhere in the prompt.

NOTE: Claude Sonnet 4 will test the ProtoFlux it has created, however it'll make numerous errors along the way and take a very long time to correct itself, along with charging you a lot of money.

TIP: To keep the assistant settings persistent: +
Right-click on the Default Assistant, enable FluxMcp in the MCP Servers, and in Model Settings set Claude 3.5 Haiku as the default model.
